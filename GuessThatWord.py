#Guess. that .word!

"""
@Noullion in github!

A small indie game. Goal is to guess the word given by the other player!.

To play, you must execute and not show the code.

I'm soon making a internal input data for the word and hint, So that it wont be a hassle always changing the string after every game, But it is what it is for now.

If you manage to turn this into that, make sure to fork it so i would know your work!^.^
