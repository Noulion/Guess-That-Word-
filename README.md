# Guess That Word

A small indie game. The goal is to guess the word given by the other player!

## Project Structure

- **GuessThatWord.py**: The main script for the game.

## Getting Started

To play, you must execute and not show the code.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Noulion/Guess-That-Word-.git
cd Guess-That-Word-
python GuessThatWord.py
```

## Planned Improvements

I'm soon making an internal input data for the word and hint, so that it won't be a hassle always changing the string after every game, but it is what it is for now.
